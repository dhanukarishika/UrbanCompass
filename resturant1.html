                 The Hot Chocolate and Brownies served at this café top the favourites chart.

                      <H2>     The Tryst Café in Chennai specializes in food items like Chicken Sandwich, Pizzas, Apple Strudel, coffee, Fajita, and bread.
                         Located in the Gatsby Village, one has to try the bakery section right at the entrance of this café.
                          Initially, bread was sourced from Pondicherry for this great café. This practice soon ended as they started baking a whole new interesting section of bread.
                           So, if you are looking for a nice cafe in Chennai with some strong European vibes, head to the Tryst café! Oh, and do not forget to gorge on their signature bread, the Kraftkorn.

                             <H2>  What started as a fashion and accessories store, has now become a beautiful venture known as 'Wild Garden Cafe - Amethyst'.
                             This lifestyle cafe in Chennai comprises a flower shop, fashion and accessories shop, and a café, which is currently hugely popular amongst the masses.

                              While the beverage section obviously draws the crowd constantly (especially their coffee), the main highlight is the availability of their amazing breakfast section 24/7.
